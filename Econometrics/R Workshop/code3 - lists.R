## PRACTICE QUESTIONS

    #1. Consider two families: the SSS family and the YYY family. Here's a list that has two
    #   elements (SSS and YYY), each is a (sub)list.  These sublists each have two vectors.
    #   Write code to "extract" the 'Alison' element (bonus points if you do this multiple ways).
    
    fams <- list(
        SSS = list(parents = c("Ron", "Su"), kids = c("Alison", "Elisabeth")),
        YYY = list(parents = c("Lorie", "Bill"), children = c("Dan", "Nick", "Matt"))
    )
    fams$SSS$kids[1]
    
    
    
    #2. I use split to make a list below.
    #   Use an `apply` function to find the mean of each list element of xx
        xx <- split(matrix(1:100, 10, 10), 1:10)
        sapply(xx, mean)
